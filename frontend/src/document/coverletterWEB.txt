This is a special cover letter for you. I'm Finn who is from China and a new man for IT. I want to be a full-stack developer, of course, I'm also can do software development if the software is interesting.
Actually, I was a Hotel Product Manager of the biggest online travel agency (Trip.com Group) in China 2.5 years ago. However, I want to see a more interesting world, so I come to  New Zealand through a WHV chance. I met some developers in my workplace in New Zealand. I found programming in NZ is a very interesting thing after communicating with them, so I start my IT life with the Master of Applied Computing at Lincoln University.
For the past 1.5 years, I have gotten good programming skills and good intern developer experience. The reason why I create this website and looking for a programming job is not only because I just got a Master's degree in Applied Computing from Lincoln University, but also because I like the feeling of creating websites and software. The joy from creating can make me keep moving.
I want to create more websites and software that can bring more joy and convenience to people. If that is also what you want, please see more detail about me. If I am the developer you want, please contact me through my e-mail. I would enjoy having the opportunity to discuss more with you and how I could use my skills to benefit our team. I look forward to hearing from you.
